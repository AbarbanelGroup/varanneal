Running this tutorial requires that you have VarAnneal installed first, 
as well as Matplotlib and Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebook). 
You need to be running Jupyter Notebook with a Python 2.x kernel.

Each example will run a *single* instance of VarAnneal.  For those who wish 
to run many path space initializations in parallel on an SGE cluster, follow 
along with the cluster code in the nnet_barimages example for now (also in 
the examples folder in this repo).

The Lorenz 96 example estimates unmeasured states and the forcing parameter 
from data, a sample of which is contained in the Lorenz96 folder here.  You can 
modify D (dimension of model), and the measured indices in the notebook itself.

The NaKL example estimates the gating variables and parameters in an NaKL model 
(Hodgkin-Huxley-like conductance based model) from voltage data, with a known 
injected current stimulus.  Again, data and stimulus files are contained here.

The MNIST example trains a 3-layer perceptron on MNIST image data.  The MNIST 
data needs to be downloaded, for now, from Paul Rozdeba's UCSD Google Drive 
account.  Just follow the instructions in the MNIST/MNIST_data folder.
