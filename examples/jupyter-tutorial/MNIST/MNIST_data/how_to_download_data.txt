For now, the MNIST data (in a VarAnneal-friendly format) is hosted on 
Paul Rozdeba's UCSD Google Drive account.  To download it, follow this link:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Do6QJQnF-FDmSpNXPMuBD-2__1SM6VqE

Extract the contents of the file mnistdata_varanneal.tar.gz into this 
directory (should be a collection of .npy files).
