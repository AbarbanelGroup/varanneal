This directory contains some code for running Sasha's bar data example on an 
SGE cluster, where multiple annealing runs are launched simultaneously with 
different initializations of network state and parameter guesses.

The submission script is specifically tailored for our research group's cluster, 
so you should modify your options accordingly.  One important thing in our 
script is calling the right version of python.
